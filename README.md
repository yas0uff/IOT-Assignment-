The River & Floodgate Monitoring System is an automated solution that monitors environmental conditions such as water level, flow rate, and rainfall in real time to prevent flooding and manage water resources effectively. 
It uses sensors like water level sensors, flow rate sensors, rainfall sensors, and temperature sensors to collect data, which is processed by an embedded ESP32 controller. 
When thresholds are reached, actuators like electric motors are triggered to open or close floodgates accordingly. In additions, an alarm as well as an LED light are used to warn nearby communities in the case of danger.  
The system is connected to a web based IoT dashboard that displays real-time data, provides alerts, and enables remote monitoring and control, helping authorities respond quickly and make informedÂ decisions.
